# The-High-Sancta

A tool for the Fallen London Wiki.

This is a simple python file to calculate the expected Echoes per Action (EPA) of the High Sancta activity. It's designed to be easily modifiable so it can be adapted in the event of any changes to the activity.

It outputs a table of information, the expected EPA, and the table in a format designed for use on the Fallen London Wiki.

If you want to run this code but do not know how to execute a python script, you can copy + paste the file into an online python compiler and it should run.
